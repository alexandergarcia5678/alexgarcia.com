        <h1>The Sting Oporation</h1>
        <h3>An Ad Council Cambaign</h3>
    <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>This project we were meant to emulate the PSA style of the Ad Council to promote the adherence to a blue law. The law of my choice stated that it is illegal in Arizona to cut down a cactus without explicit permission from the state government to do so. This is because they take a very long time to grow and can go extinct easily if the population is not maintained. I needed to make a series of billboards and a responsive website to go along with a campeign encouraging people to obey the law.</p>
    <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>First I needed to establish the details of my law so that I don't misinform the users. The first thing to understand with a project like this is that while the intention is partly to be humerous, there is still a non-fiction contract between me and the user that means I need to be careful not to stretch the truth.</p>
    <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>The concept fot this piece came later in the project than it should have. The concept was to have an officer hiding inside of a cactus ready to bust anyone who would dare to cut down the cacti on his watch. Most of the content generation for this project came from this core visual. The backgrounds are all of deserts, but some are of the desert during the day and some during the night. Having this dynamic allowed for the website to tell a story with pacing influenced by whether or not the setting in the background would be day or night. Navigating the site would be like reading through a story rather than shifting through a wikipedia style aricle.</p>
    <h4>Content</h4>
        <p>Creating the content was a process in iteration. I won the war of attrition between me and Adobe Illustrator, but it was hard faught.</p>
