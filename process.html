        <h2>Reflecting on the Ad Council Website Project</h2>
        <h4>March 29th, 2019</h4>
        <p>Sometimes it’s hard to tell if the feeling of not having done enough comes from imposter syndrome or if it’s just an observation. I kept squirming near the end of this current project I’m working on trying to find something else to do with it but being let down by myself at the realization that I set myself off  for a certain amount of work to be necessary and expanding would be adding an entire assignment worth of work to do so. So instead I settled for refining everything I could with that I already had.</p>

        <p>On the right is the old cactus man I made for this project. On the left the new. I opted for a more cactus shape to represent it instead of the crushed bananas stapled together aesthetic I seemed to have started with. I refined textures until I was no longer upset with how they did (or didn’t) blend with the rest of the illustration. And I freed myself up to put some more typography in the illustration in hopes of adding personality or rather guiding the viewer into reading the right personality into the cactus cop. </p>

<p>On the top is the old billboard, on the bottom the new. The fine details such as the type at the bottom left and the badge indicating the that this is a cop and a STING operation. I was having trouble at first determining where in the composition he should go and how to make him bigger. With the environment, I drew the only place he fit was in the middle but after reflection, I realized that I was giving too much priority to the mountains in the background. Only a few mountains are necessary for the audience to get an idea of what kind of environment it is so I was using the pride I had in my landscape illustration and my love for landscape to overtake the project. After I realized this I was able to have a shift in priorities that better favoured the problem presented by the project at hand. I think this creates a better composition overall and helps to provide necessary details in a shorter amount of time.</p>
