        <h1>Favorite Things Website</h1>
        <h3>My First Website Design in My First Web Design Class</h3>
    <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>For this assignment we were tasked with presenting three of our favorite things. I misread the assignment and did three of my three favorite things. If that's confusing, then I'm glad you understand.</p>
            
            <p>This was the first assignment given in my web design class. I got two things out of the assignment. One was that I got thrusted into the idea of web design that I never really considered before, this being my first venture into web designis reflected in the quality. The other reason for this project was for my classmates and I to get used to Photoshop as a web design tool while we're still not thinking of our work as precious. I had no end of troubles with Photoshop and it was an important lesson on why it shouldn't be used for web design when there are alternatives.</p>
    <h4>Research</h4>
        <img src="Images/Screenshot_Fav%20Things%20Sketches.png.jpg" class="artimg"> <p class="caption">The point isn't that you understand what I wrote because neither can I. The point is that you can see I went to my sketchbook before I went to my computer.</p>
        <p>The first thing I do when I recieve a new project is take inventory of what's technically required. For this website I needed a homepage, an about page explaining what the website was and what users were supposed to get out of being there, a system for multiple articles that was replicable so that future articles could in theory be written, and then of course the usually CTAs and resources such as headers and footers.</p>
        <p>The only other thing I needed to do was establish what my three categories of three favorite things were. After deliberation I came to favorite: cities, movies I've never seen, and music genres. </p>
    <h4>Concept</h4>
        <img src="Images/Screenshot_Fav%20Things%20Wires.png" class="artimg">
        <p>This assignment came long before I incorporated things like mood into my concept. I was still thinking about concept as just a visual system that works with its content, rather than a system produced through working out the problem and figuring out the overall goal. Now, mood is one of the first things I establish, and I do so well before I move on to the visual elements, using the mood, concept, and goal to guide the concept of those fisual elements while using the requirements from the research to keep them structured. I go into more detail on my current process on the <a href="process.html">My Process</a> section of this website. Check it out if you're interested.</p>
        <p>The concept for this website was just to have virticle columns of text with banner images leading you into each item on the article lists. The arrangement of the type and the sizes may be disconnected from any real concept, but they serve the job of containing the information for the audience and being templatable enough to be reused with other article ideas, they do wo without working with the goal of the website to enhance the experience of being on it.</p>
    <h4>Content</h4>
        
        <p>In generating the content for this website I needed to gather free to use photos for all the cities and movies. The photos neded to be able to act as banners across the screen and to achieve this I needed to do photo-editing of the movie images to make them long enough. For the music genres I realized I didn't necessarily have a way to show them visually with images unless I wanted to take pictures of album covers or band photos that I like. I didn't want to do this because while my genre tastes don't change much, which bands in those genres do, so I needed something for the genres themselves. </p>
        <img src="Images/Screenshot_Fav%20Things_Music.png" class="artimg">
        <p>I took a colorful image and put it through audition to databend it in accordance with the general sound of the genre in question. The three genres, rap, electronic rock, and lo-fi lead to interesting and distinct results when used to filter the same image.</p>
